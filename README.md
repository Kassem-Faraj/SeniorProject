# Project description
As part of my computer science senior project, i developed a set of machine learning algorithms that would predicted ideal crops based on soil data. These models are to be used inside a web app, through a communication of a RESTful API made via the backend.

## Tools used
1) Pandas for data retriveal and exploration
2) Numpy for data manipulation 
3) Sci-kit learn for model development
4) Flask to make a production ready application for crop predictions as a RESTful API.
