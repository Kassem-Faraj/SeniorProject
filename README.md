# Project description
As part of my computer science senior project, i developed a set of machine learning algorithms that would predicted ideal crops based on soil data. These models are to be used inside a web app, through a communication of a RESTful API made via the backend.
# Running the project
Steps:

1) Install python from this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2) Commands needed for installing:
```
pip install Flask
```
```
pip install numpy
```
> **_NOTE:_**  The note content.
Use sci-kit learn 1.4.2 version
```
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
```
pip install scikit-learn==1.4.2
```


## Tools used
1) Pandas for data retriveal and exploration
2) Numpy for data manipulation 
3) Sci-kit learn for model development
4) Flask to make a production ready application for crop predictions as a RESTful API, used in an web application.
